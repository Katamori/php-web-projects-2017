to-do:

- high priority:
    - ensure proper security...
    - huge overhaul for the YT crawler
    - add new tables to x_doom db: authors, speedrunners, trusted uploaders(?)   


- medium priority:
    - extend MAL watchlist viewer with proper features
    - update cronjob (not visible on GitHub due to plaintext password contained)
        - multi-thread cronjob
    - hide login inputs when AJAX request is sent
    - hide login inputs if you're already logged in
    - Reddit statistics database (for reader amounts at least)
    - SCP database(?) 

- low priority:
    - some CSS design for some proper look
    - start differentiating beta/unstable vs public/master 
        - different branch in Git?


- done:
    - fix MAL script on server [apparently done]

dee az is megteszi hogy lekapom mindenféle hírportálról a híreket, timestamppel, 
és napra, sőt órára lebontva szöveg szerinti elemzést baszatok rá

Some very-very simple documentation on the structure of the server, to make myself, and potentially, anyone
downloading it from GitHub a bit less confused on the usage of it.

- index.php has the obvious function: that is a main page.
    - it's fairly possible I'll make it back to a simple plain HTML as I have no need to use php there.
    - currently, index.php also contains two login forms instead of redirect.
- EVERY non-specific(!) php-only script must be put into the /php folder.

- /hostinger folder contains the stuff I design to be used from remote access at katamori.16mb.com
    - index.php contains a login form that sends database login info to "/hostinger/redirect.php"
    - every script using database queries must include "/hostinger/dbjoin.php" at the beginning
    - db_doom.php contains a jQuery script that, via a checkbox, changes between AJAX and regular submission
        - it is done by jQuery, which occasionally turn the "submit" event listener on and off

- /myanimelist contains stuff I want to do with the MyAnimeList.net API
    - "index.php" contains the login form that then tries establishing authorization via "/myanimelist/mal_auth.php"
        - "/myanimelist/mal_auth.php" gets the redirect "names" through the dropdown list's names
        - moreover, this file must not contain any additional HTML code 
    - after login "/myanimelist/watchlist.php" lists the user's anime watchlist

php code examples:

1) secure SQL query, source: http://stackoverflow.com/a/60496/2320153

$stmt = $dbConnection->prepare('SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name = ?');
$stmt->bind_param('s', $name);

$stmt->execute();

$result = $stmt->get_result();
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    // do something with $row
}
