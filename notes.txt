dee az is megteszi hogy lekapom mindenféle hírportálról a híreket, timestamppel, 
és napra, sőt órára lebontva szöveg szerinti elemzést baszatok rá

Some very-very simple documentation on the structure of the server, to make myself, and potentially, anyone
downloading it from GitHub a bit less confused on the usage of it.

- index.php has the obvious function: that is a main page.
    - it's fairly possible I'll make it back to a simple plain HTML as I have no need to use php there.
    - currently, index.php also contains two login forms instead of redirect.
- EVERY php-only script must be put into the /php folder.

- /hostinger folder contains the stuff I design to be used from remote access at katamori.16mb.com
    - index.php contains a login form that sends database login info to "/hostinger/redirect.php"
    - every script using database queries must include "/hostinger/dbjoin.php" at the beginning

- /myanimelist contains stuff I want to do with the MyAnimeList.net API
    - "index.php" contains the login form that then tries establishing authorization via "/myanimelist/mal_auth.php"
        - "/myanimelist/mal_auth.php" gets the redirect "names" through the dropdown list's names
        - moreover, this file must not contain any additional HTML code 
    - after login "/myanimelist/watchlist.php" lists the user's anime watchlist
